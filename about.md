The **Nordic Alcohol Data Project** is a new, mordern, digital provider of Nordic alcohol monopoly data and insights. We empower suppliers to make smart business decisions based on both historic and near live data.

<a href="https://bolaget-site.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Find out more about us here.</a>

In **this blog** we explore that data and discover a few interesting things on the way. That means we're going to look at some **real data** and come to some **real conclusions**. Some of those will be directly actionable business insights. Some will just be fun bits of trivia. We're a fan of both.

*Thank you for reading!*
