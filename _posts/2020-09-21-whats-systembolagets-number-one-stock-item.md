It's time for some trivia. Here are some interesting things we've found out in our travels through Systembolaget's data.

Right now, there is 3 million SEK of Norrlands Guld Export sitting in Systemet stores across Sweden (...I wish I could buy it all). **But what's the most valuable item is at Systemet?**

<!--more-->

**Bags! 45 million SEK worth of bags.** A veritable kings ransom of plastic. It destroys its closest competitor *Explorer Vodka* at a mere 5.4 million SEK.

But maybe you're not terribly interested in bags. So let's ask a much more serious business question: **How big of a party could I throw with all the Vodka in Stockholm?**

Maybe you can think of a better question to ask if you had access to both geographically detailed and historical stock data, but I'm going to plan a party. There are around 19 500 litres of vodka sitting in store across Stockholm County, and if you poured it into one huge bottle the resulting drink would be 38.17%. Let's say that ten 33ml shots of that is enough per guest. **That makes our 19 500 litres enough for 65 thousand people**. Which is a decent number of people. But at a price tag of 6.2 million SEK (plus snacks), it's a party I won't be throwing any time soon. If we were to go back in time and throw it the day of the first kr√§ftskiva of the year (the first Wednesday of August), it would have been 21 thousand litres and 6.9 million SEK. That's probably just standard fluctuation, but I like to imagine they were prepared.

That leaves more very practical and very useful question. **How much of Globan's 605,000 cubic meters volume could one fill with Systemet's entire store inventory?** The 14,307,793 litres of their stock could fill it up 2.31% full.

In later articles we'll be looking at how to use this data to answer more realistic business questions. In particular, I think we could use geographic stock data to answer a lot more interesting questions. But this was fun for now. Thanks for reading!
