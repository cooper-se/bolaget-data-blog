A key part of our product offering is that we offer "near-real-time" data. We do this so our API customers can react quickly to the things that are important to them.

We love APIs, but we also want give you guys access to this data in a much easier and more convenient way. So we made all this data into a simple and easy to use website.

It focuses on the very latest changes to Systembolaget articles. But it also contains a deep history of both the articles and the stock levels. On top of that we've thrown in a few charts and analytics.
