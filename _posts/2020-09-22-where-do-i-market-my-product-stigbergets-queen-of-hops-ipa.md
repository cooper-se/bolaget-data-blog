Let's take a first step towards data based marketing by looking at basic geographical data.

<!--more-->

Where is the product at? Where is it on shelves? Marketing is a complex domain, and a lot of other things can inform our decision making, but I don't think we're ever going to get completely away from that simple question. Luckily, it's easily answered by our up-to-date stock data.

**So where is Stigbergets Queen of Hops IPA on shelves?** The answer in this case is mostly in Göteborg, a bit in Falun and Sundsvall, and scatterings elsewhere. You can see the Göteborg part in this article's feature image.

But since we also have historical data, there's another and much more interesting question we can ask ourselves. **Has my product newly appeared anywhere in significant numbers? And has it disappeared from anywhere else?**. In this case yes! It's new in Falun, it's holding stable in Göteborg, but disappearing in the South. Perhaps it's time to pay attention to the good people of Dalarna?

But of course this is a very simple example. In reality we'd take a lot more data into account. But I think that a view on where stock is now and a clear view of how its moving and changing over time would be a very valuable component in that decision.
